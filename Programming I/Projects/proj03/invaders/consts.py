Constants for Alien Invaders

This module global constants for the game Alien Invaders. These constants need to be used
in the model, the view, and the controller. As these are spread across multiple modules,
we separate the constants into their own module. This allows all modules to access them.

### USE COMMAND LINE ARGUMENTS TO CHANGE NUMBER OF ALIENS IN A ROW"""
"""
sys.argv is a list of the command line arguments when you run python. These arguments are
everything after the word python. So if you start the game typing

    python invaders 3 4 0.5

Python puts ['breakout.py', '3', '4', '0.5'] into sys.argv. Below, we take advantage of
this fact to change the constants ALIEN_ROWS, ALIENS_IN_ROW, and ALIEN_SPEED.
