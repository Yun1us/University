Primary module for Alien Invaders

This module contains the main controller class for the Alien Invaders app. 
There is no need for any additional classes in this module.  If you need 
more classes, 99% of the time they belong in either the wave module or the 
models module. If you are unsure about where a new class should go, post a 
question on Piazza.

class Invaders(GameApp):
    """
    The primary controller class for the Alien Invaders application
    
    This class extends GameApp and implements the various methods necessary 
    for processing the player inputs and starting/running a game.
    
        Method start begins the application.
    
        Method update either changes the state or updates the Play object
    
        Method draw displays the Play object and any other elements on screen
    
    Because of some of the weird ways that Kivy works, you SHOULD NOT create 
    an initializer __init__ for this class.  Any initialization should be done 
    in the start method instead.  This is only for this class.  All other 
    classes behave normally.
    
    Most of the work handling the game is actually provided in the class Wave.
    Wave should be modeled after subcontrollers.py from lecture, and will 
    have its own update and draw method.
    
    The primary purpose of this class is to manage the game state: which is 
    when the game started, paused, completed, etc. It keeps track of that in 
    an internal (hidden) attribute.
    
    For a complete description of how the states work, see the specification 
    for the method update.
    
    Attribute view: the game view, used in drawing 
    Invariant: view is an instance of GView (inherited from GameApp)
    
    Attribute input: user input, used to control the ship or resume the game
    Invariant: input is an instance of GInput (inherited from GameApp)
    """
    # HIDDEN ATTRIBUTES:
    # Attribute _state: the current state of the game represented as an int
    # Invariant: _state is one of STATE_INACTIVE, STATE_NEWWAVE, STATE_ACTIVE, 
    # STATE_PAUSED, STATE_CONTINUE, or STATE_COMPLETE
    #
    # Attribute _wave: the subcontroller for a single wave, managing aliens
    # Invariant: _wave is a Wave object, or None if there is no wave currently 
    # active. It is only None if _state is STATE_INACTIVE.
    #
    # Attribute _text: the currently active message
    # Invariant: _text is a GLabel object, or None if there is no message to 
    # display. It is onl None if _state is STATE_ACTIVE.
    #
    # You may have new attributes if you wish (you might want an attribute to
    # store any score across multiple waves). But you must document them.
    # LIST MORE ATTRIBUTES (AND THEIR INVARIANTS) HERE IF NECESSARY

        Initializes the application.
        
        This method is distinct from the built-in initializer __init__ (which 
        you should not override or change). This method is called once the 
        game is running. You should use it to initialize any game specific 
        attributes.
        
        This method should make sure that all of the attributes satisfy the 
        given invariants. When done, it sets the _state to STATE_INACTIVE and 
        create a message (in attribute _text) saying that the user should press 
        to play a game.

        Animates a single frame in the game.
        
        It is the method that does most of the work. It is NOT in charge of 
        playing the game.  That is the purpose of the class Wave. The primary 
        purpose of this game is to determine the current state, and -- if the 
        game is active -- pass the input to the Wave object _wave to play the 
        game.
        
        As part of the assignment, you are allowed to add your own states. 
        However, at a minimum you must support the following states: 
        STATE_INACTIVE, STATE_NEWWAVE, STATE_ACTIVE, STATE_PAUSED, 
        STATE_CONTINUE, and STATE_COMPLETE.  Each one of these does its own 
        thing and might even needs its own helper.  We describe these below.
        
        STATE_INACTIVE: This is the state when the application first opens.  
        It is a paused state, waiting for the player to start the game.  It 
        displays a simple message on the screen. The application remains in 
        this state so long as the player never presses a key.  In addition, 
        this is the state the application returns to when the game is over 
        (all lives are lost or all aliens are dead).
        
        STATE_NEWWAVE: This is the state creates a new wave and shows it on 
        the screen. The application switches to this state if the state was 
        STATE_INACTIVE in the previous frame, and the player pressed a key. 
        This state only lasts one animation frame before switching to 
        STATE_ACTIVE.
        
        STATE_ACTIVE: This is a session of normal gameplay.  The player can 
        move the ship and fire laser bolts.  All of this should be handled 
        inside of class Wave (NOT in this class).  Hence the Wave class 
        should have an update() method, just like the subcontroller example 
        in lecture.
        
        STATE_PAUSED: Like STATE_INACTIVE, this is a paused state. However, 
        the game is still visible on the screen.
        
        STATE_CONTINUE: This state restores the ship after it was destroyed. 
        The application switches to this state if the state was STATE_PAUSED 
        in the previous frame, and the player pressed a key. This state only 
        lasts one animation frame before switching to STATE_ACTIVE.
        
        STATE_COMPLETE: The wave is over, and is either won or lost.
        
        You are allowed to add more states if you wish. Should you do so, you should
        describe them here.
        
        Parameter dt: The time in seconds since last update
        Precondition: dt is a number (int or float)

        Every single thing you want to draw in this game is a GObject.  To 
        draw a GObject g, simply use the method g.draw(self.view).  It is 
        that easy!
        
        Many of the GObjects (such as the ships, aliens, and bolts) are 
        attributes in Wave. In order to draw them, you either need to add 
        getters for these attributes or you need to add a draw method to 
        class Wave.  We suggest the latter.  See the example subcontroller.py 
        from class.
